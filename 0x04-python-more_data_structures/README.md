## Files in this directory and what they do
#### [0-square_matrix_simple.py](./0-square_matrix_simple.py)
- function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
- I realized from here that the `map` function is typically used on 1d iterables
- `map` function is not to perform nested iterations and operations

#### [1-search_replace.py](./1-search_replace.py)
- function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
- solved with list comprehension, yay ! :)

#### [2-uniq_add.py](./2-uniq_add.py)
- function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer)
- converted to set then back to list
